Elite Player Frame gives your Player Frame the Gold Elite dragon by default, but
you can change it via the following slash commands:

/epf elite		- Adds the gold dragon to your Player Frame
/epf rare		- Adds the silver dragon to your Player Frame
/epf lumpy		- Adds little silver lumps to your Player Frame
/epf undead		- Makes your Player Frame black with a skull on top
/epf undeadelite	- Adds a black dragon with a skull head to the Player Frame
/epf elf		- Makes plants grow from your Player Frame
/epf elfelite		- Adds a pretty wooden texture around the Player Frame
